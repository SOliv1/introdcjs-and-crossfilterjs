    #Bringing Data To Life With Visualizations
    
This repo contains the solution code for the Bringing Data To Life With Visualizations lesson
What is it?
Data visualizations are great way of taking data and rendering it in a way that will give users a good insight into what's going on with their data. For example, it would show charts and graphs that will inform the users viewing the as to how well store in certain states, compare to stores in other states. Or which people are spending more than others in the store.
This kind of representation can be used to give really quick insights into various types of statistics.
There are a number of technologies that can be combined to present this kind of information, and we'll be using Scalable Vector Graphics, D3.js, DC.js and Crossfilter.js.
The combination of these technologies will allow us to create fully interactive charts and graphs.
What is covered
Throughout this lesson we'll learn how to create different types of charts and graphs, and how we can filter the data in different ways using Crossfilter.js
